# SSSwin: Sequential Spectral Swin Transformer for Solar Panel Mapping in Satellite Imagery

Zhiyuan Yang, Ryan Rad

### Abstract
Global sustainability is increasingly reliant on solar energy. However, effectively monitoring solar farms and accurately assessing our progress in transitioning towards this renewable energy source remains a challenge, especially on a global scale. This study introduces SSSwin, a novel vision transformer model specifically developed to improve the mapping of solar panel farms using satellite imagery. The cornerstone of SSSwin is its Sequential Spectral Embedding module, uniquely designed to address the three-dimensional aspects of multispectral satellite images, enabling intricate capture of spatial-spectral data. To validate its effectiveness, we incorporated our new module into the design of two state-of-the-art models: UPerNet-SwinB and Mask2Former-SwinB. The experimental results demonstrate that this integration enhanced both of their performance without compromising efficiency.
